In October 2020, four HIV units of general public hospitals of Buenos Aires city began an implementation study of telemedicine (TM) for the care of people living with HIV(PLHIV). TM visits were conducted through phone or videocalls. This research aims to comprehend the motivations of patients willing to continue using TM for HIV care. We prospectively collected quantitative and qualitative data through an anonymous, electronic survey delivered to patients after their first TM visit. Instruments collected data on: 1) socio-demographic characteristics; 2) willingness and motivations to continue using TM. The latter was an open-ended question. We used Orange Data MiningÂ® software to process the qualitative data. These results show the main factors that determine the user's decision to continue using the TM.

The survey was delivered to 3673 patients who had their first remote-visit between October 2020 and January 2022. 1545 patients (42%) answered the survey. 1009 users were willing to continue using TM (65%). 565 were self-identified as male (56%) and 417 as female (41%). 27 did not answer it (3%). Median age was 45 years old (IQR: 35-53).
